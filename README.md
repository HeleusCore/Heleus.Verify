# Heleus Verify

Powerful data verification for everyone. We want to make it easy to verify files that you download or share with other people. Text based checksums help to verify files, but they are clumsy to use. We have a simple way for you to verify files and to publish verifications for your own files. More info and free download: https://heleuscore.com/verify.
